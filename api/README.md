# private-api

`private-api` server should contain all logic related to `demo-server` and `demo-db`.

ideally, we should have env variable `isServerDemo` with boolean value.
this env variable and logic should not be part of public repository for `private-api` server.

# current tasks

- draw out onboarding flow for new user
- draw out UI for Team-less user

---

- finish working on `api` server (see notes on paper)
